# CounterProgram
Hey there! ðŸ™Œ I built this simple counter app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML part sets up all the main elements you see on the page, like the number display and the buttons you can click to increase, decrease, or reset the count.

For the styling, I used internal CSS, which means all the CSS code is written right inside the HTML file. This makes it super easy to tweak the look and feel without jumping between multiple files. Thanks to this, the counter looks clean, colorful, and user-friendly âœ¨.

All the interactive stuff is powered by external JavaScript stored in a separate .js file. This script handles all the button clicks and updates the number in real time, so you can keep counting up or down without reloading the page âš¡.

Overall, itâ€™s a fun little project that shows how you can combine HTML for structure, CSS for style, and JavaScript for interactivity to create something cool and functional! ðŸŽ¨ðŸ’»
